        <h1>C</h1>
       
        <h4>It is used in embedded programming</h4>
                
                <p>C is used in embedded programming, which is used to control micro-controllers. These micro-controllers are used in robotics, computers, and automation. Learning C can help you here as well.</p>
        <h4>It is simple to understand</h4>
               
                <p>C programming language uses blocks to separate pieces of code performing different tasks. This helps make programming easier and keeps the code clean. Thus, the code is easy to understand even for those who are starting out.</p>
                
        <h4>It is fast</h4>
                
                    <p>The programs that you write in C compile and execute much faster than those written in other languages. This is because it does not have garbage collection and other such additional processing overheads. Hence, the language is faster as compared to most other programming languages. This is one of the reasons why C is used even today for programming.</p>
                
            <h4>It is used to build PC games</h4>
             
                    <p>C finds use in many PC games. It has been used to code various small games and some tasks in bigger games as well. Thus, learning C can be beneficial if you are aspiring to make a career in game development.</p>

        <h2>Phyton</h2>
        <h4>Easy to Learn</h4>
                    <p>he syntax of various other languages might seem very confusing to you when you just start coding. But, the minimal setup and readability of Python allows you to think like a programmer and saves your time in writing a big syntax format. The syntax of this amazing language is easy and this makes it easier to type and compile. For instance, if you want to build a code that says “Hello World”, it would require you to type around 4 lines in Java, wherein in Python, all you need to write is – print(“Hello World”)</p>
                
        <h4>Readily Available Resources to Learn From</h4>
                    <p>Python is an open-source language, which is free and can be used by anyone. The internet is filled with Python programming courses and tutorials, which provide a broad scope of opportunities for beginners to actually hit and try to narrow down the niche in which they are better than others. </p>

        <h4>The Extensibility Behaviour of Python</h4>
                       
                     <p>Extensibility in software and languages refers to the ability of the software to extend to include new additions with minimal to no change in the existing code. Simply put, it is the measure of how easily a new behavior can be added to its existing structure and code. Several programming languages like Tcl and Python, are highly extensible. </p>
                        
        <h4>Python Community Allows You to Learn From the Experts</h4>
                        
                    <p>Once your learning phase is over, and you start coding on your own, you might come across an obstacle or two. This is where the Python community will support you to learn from your own mistakes and learn from their experts indirectly.  </p>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <h4>JavaScript caters to beginner, intermediate, and advanced developers</h4>
            <p>JavaScript does not need any environment setup; just open a browser, like Chrome, navigate to Developer Tools, and start coding. Writing a "Hello World" program is as simple as:
              <br>console.log("Hello World");</p>
        <h4>Omni-platform</h4>
                <p>JavaScript can run everywhere, including:<br>

                    Devices like mobiles, tablets, and laptops
                    On the client-side as well as the server-side
                    This ability to run everywhere makes JavaScript a universal language.</p>
        <h4>Open standards and community</h4>
                    <p>ECMAScript is the standardized version of JavaScript as well as an open standard language. Companies can use ECMAScript to create a JavaScript implementation. According to Wikipedia, "an ECMAScript engine  is a program that executes source code written in a version of the ECMAScript language standard, for example, JavaScript." The most popular engines, V8 and SpiderMonkey, are open source projects.

                        JavaScript has been around for 25 years and has a vast community behind it. A developer is spoiled for choice. The community has built so many plugins and frameworks that the phrase "framework fatigue" was coined.</p>
        <h4>Modern frameworks</h4>
                        <p>Modern frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js have stabilized and are being optimized for better performance. Most frameworks are very developer-friendly with good community support</p>
